Don't want bad-quality code to be deployed to your organization's sandbox?<br/>
Apex code inspector is a powerful, flexible tool which helps to control quality of a code, deployed to your sandbox. There are several useful plugins available right "from a box", they are:
<ol>
  <li>
    SOQL in loops plugin - will help to find SOQL in loops to avoid SOQL limitations
  </li>
  <li>
    DML in loops plugin - will help to detect operations with database in loops.
  </li>
</ol>

<b>If you wish, you can write your own plugin!</b> That's easy: you need only to implement an interface and write your own rules to examinate code quality, and system will automatically detect your plugin and add it to the list of available plugins.
Moreover, the app has simple and neat UI, which allows to work with it right after it's install.<br/>
